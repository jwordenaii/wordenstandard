# Monitoring Guide

How to monitor the JWordenAI backend in production.

---

## Datadog + Slack Alerting

The API ships metrics and error events to Datadog and fires Slack alerts whenever something breaks. This section covers setup, alert types, and how to view metrics in the Datadog dashboard.

### Setup

#### 1. Datadog API Key

1. Log in to [app.datadoghq.com](https://app.datadoghq.com) → **Organization Settings** → **API Keys**
2. Create a new key named `jworden-api-production`
3. Copy the key value

#### 2. Slack Incoming Webhook

1. Go to [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) → **Create New App** → **From scratch**
2. Name it `JWordenAI Alerts`, select your workspace
3. Under **Features** → **Incoming Webhooks**, toggle **Activate Incoming Webhooks** on
4. Click **Add New Webhook to Workspace**, choose the `#alerts` channel (or create one)
5. Copy the webhook URL (starts with `https://hooks.slack.com/services/...`)

#### 3. Add Environment Variables to Railway

In the Railway dashboard → API service → **Variables**, add:

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `DATADOG_API_KEY` | Your Datadog API key |
| `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` | Your Slack incoming webhook URL |
| `DD_ENV` | `production` (or `staging`) |
| `DD_SERVICE` | `jworden-api` |

Redeploy the API service after adding the variables.

---

### Alert Types and Thresholds

| Alert | Trigger | Severity | Channel |
|---|---|---|---|
| **API 5xx Error** | Any HTTP 500–599 response | ❌ Error | Slack + Datadog event |
| **High Error Rate** | >5% of requests fail over 5 min | 🚨 Critical | Slack + Datadog event |
| **High Latency** | p95 response time >1000ms | ⚠️ Warning | Slack + Datadog event |
| **Database Failure** | PostgreSQL connection refused | 🚨 Critical | Slack + Datadog event |
| **Elasticsearch Down** | ES cluster unreachable | ⚠️ Warning | Slack + Datadog event |

All alerts include the service name, environment, and git version so you can immediately identify which deployment is affected.

---

### Monitoring Endpoints

#### Public Health Check

```
GET /api/v1/monitoring/health
```

No authentication required. Checks database and Redis connectivity. Returns HTTP 200 when healthy, HTTP 503 when degraded. Use this URL for Datadog Synthetic monitors and external uptime checkers.

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "jworden-api",
  "checks": {
    "database": {"ok": true, "latency_ms": 2.1},
    "redis": {"ok": true, "latency_ms": 0.8}
  },
  "elapsed_ms": 3.4
}
```

#### Admin Monitoring Status

```bash
curl -s "$BASE/api/v1/admin/monitoring/status" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MASTER_KEY"
```

Returns the full monitoring configuration: which integrations are active, alert thresholds, and the list of tracked metrics.

---

### Datadog Dashboard

Once `DATADOG_API_KEY` is set and the API is receiving traffic, metrics appear in Datadog automatically.

#### Key Metrics to Watch

| Metric | Description | Alert threshold |
|---|---|---|
| `api.request.latency_ms` | Per-request latency tagged by path/method/status | p95 > 1000ms |
| `api.errors.5xx` | Count of 5xx responses | Any occurrence |
| `api.health_check.latency_ms` | Health check probe latency | > 500ms |
| `api.health_check.status` | 1 = healthy, 0 = degraded | 0 for >2 checks |
| `api.db.connection_failures` | Database connection failure count | Any occurrence |
| `api.elasticsearch.unavailable` | Elasticsearch unavailability count | Any occurrence |

#### Creating a Dashboard

1. Datadog → **Dashboards** → **New Dashboard** → name it `JWordenAI API`
2. Add a **Timeseries** widget: metric `api.request.latency_ms`, group by `path`
3. Add a **Query Value** widget: metric `api.errors.5xx`, aggregation `sum`
4. Add a **Monitor** → **New Monitor** → **Metric** → alert when `api.errors.5xx > 0`

#### Setting Up Datadog Monitors

1. Datadog → **Monitors** → **New Monitor** → **Metric**
2. Define the metric: `sum:api.errors.5xx{service:jworden-api}.as_count()`
3. Set alert condition: `> 0` over the last 5 minutes
4. Add notification: `@slack-alerts` (connect Datadog ↔ Slack via the Slack integration)

---

### Testing Alerts

#### Trigger a Slack Alert (5xx test)

```bash
# Hit a non-existent endpoint to generate a 404 (won't alert — only 5xx triggers)
curl -s "$BASE/api/v1/does-not-exist"

# To test a real 5xx, temporarily break a dependency (e.g. wrong DATABASE_URL)
# and watch for the Slack message in #alerts
```

#### Verify Datadog Metrics

```bash
# Check the monitoring status endpoint
curl -s "$BASE/api/v1/admin/monitoring/status" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MASTER_KEY" | python3 -m json.tool
```

Look for `"datadog_enabled": true` and `"slack_enabled": true` in the response.

#### Check Datadog Events Stream

Datadog → **Events** → **Explorer** → filter by `service:jworden-api` to see all error events.

---

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| No Slack alerts | `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` not set | Add the env var and redeploy |
| No Datadog metrics | `DATADOG_API_KEY` not set | Add the env var and redeploy |
| `"datadog_enabled": false` | API key missing or empty | Check Railway variable spelling |
| Slack webhook returns 403 | Webhook URL revoked | Regenerate in Slack app settings |
| Alerts firing for every request | Middleware bug | Check `app/main.py` middleware logic |
| Health check always 503 | DB or Redis down | Check `DATABASE_URL` and `REDIS_URL` |

---

## Synthetic Reliability Monitor (24/7)

The repo now includes a lightweight synthetic monitor script and scheduled workflow:

- Script: `npm run ops:reliability-synthetic`
- Workflow: `.github/workflows/reliability-synthetic-monitor.yml` (every 15 minutes)
- Artifacts: `docs/reliability/latest-synthetic.json` and `docs/reliability/latest-synthetic.md`

### Required Secrets for Production Probing

| Secret | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `RELIABILITY_BASE_URL` | Base URL of the production API (for example `https://api.example.com`) |
| `RELIABILITY_ADMIN_TOKEN` | Optional bearer token to probe `/api/v1/ops/self-heal/status` |

If `RELIABILITY_BASE_URL` is not set, the workflow records a skipped run (so CI stays green) until production URL configuration is complete.

### Self-Heal Status Endpoint

```bash
curl -s "$BASE/api/v1/ops/self-heal/status" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MASTER_KEY"
```

Use this endpoint to verify:
1. Self-heal enabled/disabled state
2. Last self-heal run status and timestamps
3. Consecutive failure counters and recovery actions
4. Whether autonomy was auto-frozen during sustained infra degradation

---

## Health Check Endpoints

### Primary Health Check

```
GET /health
```

No authentication required. Returns immediately without touching the database or Redis.

```json
{"status": "ok", "service": "JWordenAI"}
```

**Use this URL for:**
- Railway health check path (set in service Settings)
- External uptime monitors (UptimeRobot, Better Uptime, Pingdom)
- Load balancer health probes

**Expected behaviour:**
- `200 OK` — service is running
- `502 Bad Gateway` — service is down or restarting
- `503 Service Unavailable` — Railway is deploying a new version

### OpenAPI Schema (Liveness Indicator)

```
GET /openapi.json
```

Returns the full OpenAPI schema. A successful response confirms the FastAPI application loaded all routers without import errors.

## Railway Built-In Metrics

Every Railway service exposes real-time metrics in the dashboard under the **Metrics** tab:

| Metric | What to watch for |
|---|---|
| **CPU usage** | Sustained >80% — scale up or add workers |
| **Memory usage** | Approaching the service limit — check for memory leaks |
| **Network in/out** | Sudden spikes may indicate a traffic surge or scraper activity |
| **Replica count** | Confirm the expected number of replicas are running |

### Viewing Logs

```bash
# Stream live logs for the API service
railway logs --service api

# Stream live logs for the Celery worker
railway logs --service worker

# Show the last 200 lines
railway logs --service api --tail 200
```

Key log patterns to watch for:

| Pattern | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `JWordenAI backend starting up` | Successful startup |
| `Database tables verified/created` | DB connection succeeded |
| `Sentry initialised` | Sentry is active |
| `Could not create database tables` | DB connection failed — check `DATABASE_URL` |
| `Sentry init failed` | `SENTRY_DSN` is set but invalid |
| `OpenAI vision call failed` | OpenAI API error — check `OPENAI_API_KEY` and quota |
| `Could not save session messages` | Redis or DB write error |

---

## Setting Up Railway Alerts

1. Open the Railway dashboard → **Project Settings** → **Notifications**
2. Connect a Slack workspace or webhook URL
3. Enable alerts for:
   - **Deployment failed** — triggers when a build or start fails
   - **Service crashed** — triggers when a service exits unexpectedly
   - **Health check failed** — triggers when `/health` stops returning 200

### Recommended Alert Thresholds

| Alert | Threshold | Action |
|---|---|---|
| API health check failure | 2 consecutive failures | Page on-call engineer |
| Worker service crash | Any crash | Investigate Redis connectivity |
| Deployment failure | Any failure | Check build logs for import errors |
| CPU > 90% for 5 minutes | Sustained | Scale up API replicas |

## Interpreting Key Endpoints

### Analytics Dashboard

```bash
curl -s "$BASE/api/v1/analytics/dashboard" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MASTER_KEY"
```

Returns a full business intelligence payload. Key fields to monitor:

- `total_leads` — total leads in the database
- `hot_leads` — leads scored HOT (high-value, urgent)
- `conversion_rate` — percentage of leads that reached `won` stage
- `avg_response_time_hours` — average time from lead creation to first contact

### Revenue Forecast

```bash
curl -s "$BASE/api/v1/analytics/revenue-forecast" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MASTER_KEY"
```

Projects revenue from HOT leads using win rate and average job value. Use this weekly to track pipeline health.

### CRM Funnel

```bash
curl -s "$BASE/api/v1/crm/funnel" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MASTER_KEY"
```

Returns lead counts by pipeline stage. A healthy funnel has leads progressing through stages. Watch for:

- Large `new` count with low `contacted` count — follow-up SLA may be missed
- High `lost` count — review closed reasons for patterns

### Project Metrics Trends

```bash
curl -s "$BASE/api/v1/project-metrics/trends" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MASTER_KEY"
```

Returns portfolio-level averages:

- `cost_accuracy_pct` — how close actual costs are to estimates (target: >90%)
- `schedule_adherence_pct` — on-time delivery rate (target: >95%)
- `avg_client_nps` — client satisfaction score (target: >8.0)
- `punch_closure_pct` — punch list completion rate (target: 100%)

---

## Celery Worker Monitoring

### Check Worker Status

```bash
# From the Railway CLI or service shell
celery -A app.celery_app inspect active
celery -A app.celery_app inspect reserved
celery -A app.celery_app inspect stats
```

### Scheduled Tasks

The Celery Beat scheduler runs two periodic tasks:

| Task | Schedule | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `scrape_virginia_lis` | Every 6 hours | Scrapes Virginia LIS for permit data |
| `process_vision_batch` | Every 15 minutes | Processes queued photo inspection jobs |

If these tasks stop running, check:
1. The Beat service is running (`railway logs --service beat`)
2. Redis is reachable from the Beat service
3. The task queue is not backed up (`celery -A app.celery_app inspect active`)

### Redis Queue Depth

A growing queue depth indicates workers are falling behind. Monitor via:

```bash
# From the Railway service shell
redis-cli -u $REDIS_URL llen celery
```

If the queue depth exceeds 1000, add more Celery worker replicas.

---

## Sentry Integration (Optional)

Sentry captures unhandled exceptions and performance traces automatically when `SENTRY_DSN` is set.

### Setup

1. Create a project at [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) (Python / FastAPI)
2. Copy the DSN from **Project Settings → Client Keys**
3. Set in Railway API service variables:
   ```
   SENTRY_DSN=https://<key>@o<org>.ingest.sentry.io/<project>
   SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE=0.1
   ```
4. Redeploy the API service

### What Sentry Captures

- Unhandled Python exceptions (500 errors)
- Slow requests (when `traces_sample_rate > 0`)
- Database query performance (via SQLAlchemy integration, if configured)

### Sentry Alerts

In the Sentry dashboard, configure:
- **Issue alert** — notify on first occurrence of any new error
- **Performance alert** — notify when p95 response time exceeds 2 seconds
- **Error rate alert** — notify when error rate exceeds 1% over 5 minutes

---

## Log Aggregation

Railway streams logs to the dashboard in real time. For persistent log storage and search:

### Option A — Railway Log Drain (Recommended)

1. Railway dashboard → **Project Settings** → **Log Drains**
2. Add a drain to Datadog, Papertrail, Logtail, or any syslog-compatible endpoint
3. All services (API, Worker, Beat) stream to the same drain

### Option B — Self-Hosted (Loki + Grafana)

Deploy a Loki instance and configure the Railway log drain to send to it. Use Grafana to query and visualise logs.

### Useful Log Queries

Once logs are in an aggregation tool, use these queries:

```
# All errors in the last hour
level=error service=api

# Rate limit events
"429" service=api

# Slow database queries (if SQLAlchemy echo is enabled)
"SELECT" duration>1000ms

# Celery task failures
"Task" "FAILURE" service=worker
```

---

## Debugging Common Issues

### API returns 500 on all requests

1. Check Railway deployment logs for startup errors
2. Confirm `DATABASE_URL` is set and Postgres is running
3. Confirm `JWT_SECRET_KEY` is set
4. Check Sentry for the exception traceback

### AI endpoints return stub responses

`OPENAI_API_KEY` is not set or has exceeded its quota. Check:

```bash
railway logs --service api | grep "OpenAI"
```

### Celery tasks not executing

1. Confirm `REDIS_URL` is set in the Worker service
2. Check worker logs: `railway logs --service worker`
3. Verify Redis is reachable: `redis-cli -u $REDIS_URL ping`

### Database connection pool exhausted

Symptoms: `TimeoutError: QueuePool limit of size 10 overflow 20 reached`

Increase pool settings in Railway API service variables:

```
DB_POOL_SIZE=20
DB_MAX_OVERFLOW=40
```

Or reduce the number of concurrent requests hitting the API.

### Rate limit errors from legitimate traffic

The global limit is 200 requests/minute per IP. Individual endpoints have tighter limits. If a legitimate client is being throttled, review `app/core/limiter.py` and adjust the limits for the specific endpoint.
