health.py — Health check endpoints for Railway deployment probes.

Routes:
  GET /health        — basic liveness (already registered in main.py, kept for compat)
  GET /health/live   — liveness probe: is the process up?
  GET /health/ready  — readiness probe: are all dependencies reachable?

Railway should be configured to use /health/ready as the health check path.
Returns HTTP 200 when healthy, HTTP 503 when any critical dependency is down.
