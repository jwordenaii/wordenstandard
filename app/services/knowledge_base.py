knowledge_base.py — Structured RAG knowledge base for J. Worden & Sons.

This module provides a curated, business-specific knowledge context that is
injected into AI prompts to make answers highly specific to the company's
actual history, services, pricing, and capabilities.

Rather than querying a vector DB for every request, we use a lightweight
"context assembly" pattern:
  1. CORE FACTS  — always injected (small, high-density)
  2. DOMAIN FACTS — injected when the query matches a domain
  3. STATE FACTS  — injected when a state code is provided

This keeps token usage minimal while dramatically improving answer quality
over a generic system prompt.
