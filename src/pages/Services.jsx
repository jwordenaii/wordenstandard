const SERVICE_FAQS = [
  {
    question: 'How thick should a commercial parking lot asphalt be?',
    answer:
      'Commercial lots typically require 4"–6" of hot-mix asphalt over a compacted stone base of 6"–12". The exact spec depends on soil bearing capacity and anticipated traffic loads (cars vs. delivery trucks).',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long after paving can I sealcoat?',
    answer:
      'New asphalt should cure for at least 90 days — ideally one full summer season — before sealcoating. Applying too soon traps gases and can cause bubbling.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the difference between crack filling and crack sealing?',
    answer:
      'Crack filling uses hot-pour rubber compound to fill non-working cracks. Crack sealing (saw-cut & rout) is used for working cracks that move with temperature — it creates a wider channel for better sealant adhesion.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you handle ADA compliance for parking lots?',
    answer:
      'Yes. We install ADA-compliant handicapped stalls, access aisles, curb ramps, and signage to current ADAAG standards.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What does a General Contractor actually manage on my project?',
    answer:
      'As your GC, we handle everything: pulling all permits, hiring and scheduling licensed subcontractors, inspecting quality at every phase, managing the project budget, processing change orders, and delivering a complete punch-list sign-off. You deal with one point of contact — us — and we handle the rest.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does your interior design process work?',
    answer:
      'We start with a consultation to understand your style, budget, and functional needs. From there our designers produce digital mood boards and material palettes for your approval. Once the design is locked, we manage all vendor sourcing, procurement, and installation coordination through to the final reveal.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long do brick paver patios last compared to poured concrete?',
    answer:
      'A properly installed brick or cobblestone paver patio outlasts poured concrete by decades. Individual units can be lifted and replaced if they settle or crack — unlike concrete which requires full demolition. With a quality compacted base and polymeric sand joints, paver patios routinely last 25–50 years.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What types of stone do you use for masonry work?',
    answer:
      'We work with natural fieldstone, Pennsylvania bluestone, Virginia limestone, granite, slate, flagstone, and cultured stone veneers. Stone selection depends on the structural requirements, local availability, and your aesthetic goals. We are happy to source specialty stones for estate-level projects.',
