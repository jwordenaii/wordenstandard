const SERVICE_FAQS = [
  {
    question: 'How thick should a commercial parking lot asphalt be?',
    answer:
      'Commercial lots typically require 4"–6" of hot-mix asphalt over a compacted stone base of 6"–12". The exact spec depends on soil bearing capacity and anticipated traffic loads (cars vs. delivery trucks).',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long after paving can I sealcoat?',
    answer:
      'New asphalt should cure for at least 90 days — ideally one full summer season — before sealcoating. Applying too soon traps gases and can cause bubbling.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the difference between crack filling and crack sealing?',
    answer:
      'Crack filling uses hot-pour rubber compound to fill non-working cracks. Crack sealing (saw-cut & rout) is used for working cracks that move with temperature — it creates a wider channel for better sealant adhesion.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you handle ADA compliance for parking lots?',
    answer:
      'Yes. We install ADA-compliant handicapped stalls, access aisles, curb ramps, and signage to current ADAAG standards.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you inspect drainage and base failure before recommending overlay?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Overlay only works when the base and drainage can support it. We look for rutting, potholes, alligator cracking, ponding, soft base, utility conflicts, and traffic load before recommending repair, overlay, or full-depth replacement.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you help property managers plan annual asphalt maintenance?',
    answer:
      'Yes. We build maintenance plans that combine inspection, crack filling, sealcoating, patching, line striping, ADA upkeep, and phased budgeting so commercial lots stay safe and presentable without surprise failures.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is pavement preservation?',
    answer:
      'Pavement preservation means using the right lower-disruption treatment before pavement fails completely. Depending on condition, that can include crack filling, sealcoating, patching, drainage correction, resurfacing, or planned reconstruction instead of waiting for full-depth failure.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you decide between repair, overlay, and replacement?',
    answer:
      'We look at pavement age, base stability, drainage, crack pattern, rutting, potholes, traffic load, and utility conflicts. If the base is sound, preservation or overlay may make sense; if the base has failed, reconstruction is the better long-term fix.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What does a General Contractor actually manage on my project?',
    answer:
      'As your GC, we handle everything: pulling all permits, hiring and scheduling licensed subcontractors, inspecting quality at every phase, managing the project budget, processing change orders, and delivering a complete punch-list sign-off. You deal with one point of contact — us — and we handle the rest.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does your interior design process work?',
    answer:
      'We start with a consultation to understand your style, budget, and functional needs. From there our designers produce digital mood boards and material palettes for your approval. Once the design is locked, we manage all vendor sourcing, procurement, and installation coordination through to the final reveal.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long do brick paver patios last compared to poured concrete?',
    answer:
      'A properly installed brick or cobblestone paver patio outlasts poured concrete by decades. Individual units can be lifted and replaced if they settle or crack — unlike concrete which requires full demolition. With a quality compacted base and polymeric sand joints, paver patios routinely last 25–50 years.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What types of stone do you use for masonry work?',
    answer:
      'We work with natural fieldstone, Pennsylvania bluestone, Virginia limestone, granite, slate, flagstone, and cultured stone veneers. Stone selection depends on the structural requirements, local availability, and your aesthetic goals. We are happy to source specialty stones for estate-level projects.',

              Most paving companies show up, lay asphalt, and move on. J Worden &amp; Sons does
              something different: we treat every project — residential or commercial, $2,500 or
              $250,000 — as a long-term investment in your property. That means better materials,
              smarter planning, honest pricing, and the kind of local knowledge that only comes from
              decades of working Virginia soil, weather, and roads.

                    The most expensive pavement decision you can make is waiting too long. Once
                    water penetrates cracks and destroys the base, you are no longer looking at a
                    sealcoat — you are looking at full-depth reconstruction. J Worden &amp; Sons
                    approaches every project with a preservation-first mindset: we assess your
                    pavement&rsquo;s current condition and recommend the lowest-cost intervention
                    that extends its life, whether that&rsquo;s crack filling, sealcoating, a
                    targeted patch, or a planned overlay.

                  <p className="text-brand-navy/70 leading-relaxed">
                    Our maintenance plans for commercial property managers are built around this
                    philosophy — annual inspections, proactive crack sealing, and phased budgeting
                    so you never face a surprise six-figure parking lot replacement. Preventing
                    failure is always cheaper than fixing it. That&rsquo;s not a sales pitch;
                    it&rsquo;s pavement science.

                    A residential driveway deserves the same compaction quality as a commercial
                    parking lot. We use the same professional-grade rollers, pavers, and
                    temperature-monitoring equipment on a 1,200 sq ft driveway as we do on a
                    50,000 sq ft commercial lot. Why does this matter? Proper compaction is the
                    single biggest factor in how long asphalt lasts. Under-compacted asphalt
                    develops ruts, cracks, and soft spots within years — sometimes months.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-brand-navy/70 leading-relaxed">
                    We also monitor asphalt temperature from the plant to the mat. Hot-mix asphalt
                    must be placed and compacted within a specific temperature window — too cold and
                    it won&rsquo;t compact properly; too hot and it can burn off the binder. Our
                    crews are trained to work fast and precise, and our drainage planning ensures
                    water sheds away from your surface from day one.

                    Hidden costs and vague estimates are the #1 complaint homeowners and property
                    managers have about paving contractors. We fix that with detailed, itemized
                    quotes that spell out exactly what is included: base preparation, material
                    specs, drainage work, cleanup, and any subcontractor coordination. You know

                    Our estimates are accurate because we do the homework upfront — we assess base
                    conditions, measure drainage grades, and identify any utility conflicts before
                    quoting. Change orders happen in construction, but they should never be a
                    surprise. When scope changes, we communicate immediately, explain why, and get
                    your approval before proceeding. That&rsquo;s the standard we hold ourselves
                    to on every project, from a $3,000 driveway to a $300,000 commercial build.

                    Virginia&rsquo;s climate is uniquely punishing on asphalt. Freeze-thaw cycles
                    in the Piedmont and Northern Virginia regions crack pavement from the inside
                    out. High summer humidity slows curing. Heavy clay soils shift and settle in
                    ways that sandy or rocky substrates don&rsquo;t. A contractor who doesn&rsquo;t
                    understand these conditions will spec the wrong base depth, apply sealcoat at
                    the wrong time of year, or miss drainage problems that guarantee early failure.
